Describe REST:<br>
Representational State Transfer -- An industry standard URL naming structure

Understand what Sintra does:<br>
Sinatra is a DSL for quickly creating web applications in Ruby with minimal effort.

Understand HTTP actions, forms:<br>
HTTP Actions are used to send HTTP and HTTPS request to the server during a performance test.  
These actions, also known as HTTP verbs, include methods such as POST, PUT, DELETE and 
PATCH. A form is an HTML element used to collect input entered by the user.

Describe and understand MVC and how Sinatra employs that pattern:<br>
MVC (Model, Views, Controllers) is a framework used to separate an application’s code by function, to 
make writing, reading, and debugging code more pleasant and simple through separation of 
concerns; each group of files have specific jobs and interact with each other in very defined 
ways. Sinatra utilizes MVC via the layout of it’s file structure.
